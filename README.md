# SQlite_Restaurant

# Overview

This project was to learn the basics of SQL databases.

The user will have access to several databases that mimick the bare necessities of a restaurant. The inventory database will keep track of the units of products and the individual prices. The Table database keeps track of 7 tables, the customer's name for the table, and the party size with the option to "clear" the table. Future plans involve reserving tables for certain periods of the day that will modify what can be updated in the table database.
